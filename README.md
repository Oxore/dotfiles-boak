# Oxore's dotfiles

Welcome!

This repo contains some dotfiles from my "boak" machine. It is mostly about visual appearance.

This readme is meant to be helpful if you interest in some things this repo contains.
I use `i3wm` with `i3blocks` bar on **Gentoo Linux**, so there are distro-specific names of dependencies and may be some other specific things.

## Zsh theme

Over several years using "Agnoster" theme from [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) I've ended up with my custom minimalistic theme. It is implemented as `.misc/oh-my-zsh/themes/oxore.zsh-theme` file and symlinked to `~/.oh-my-zsh/themes/oxore.zsh-theme` on deployment.

Overall my terminal looks like this:

**Dependencies:**
[`oh-my-zsh`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

The font used on the screenshot is "Terminus" size of 14 from gentoo repository.

## Fonts

There are some fonts used previously, but I don't use them anymore.
I just leave them here for memories.

- `fonts/Monaco for Powerline.otf` for ST as `"Monaco for Powerline:weight=bold:pixelsize=11:antialias=true:autohint=true";`
- `fonts/Monaco_Linux.ttf` for gnome-terminal

Feel free to ask me anything about my dotfiles by email or opening an issue.
